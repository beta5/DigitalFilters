# DigitalFilters
This library will contain selection of digital filter functions implemented in C++.
 
For the beginning, first order low-pass filter has been implemented and tested.

In Figure 1, combination of three discrete sine waves are filtered with Ts = 0.01 seconds and w_c = 10 * 2 * PI rad/s.
